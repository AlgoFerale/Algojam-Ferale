# Algojam Ferale

> “I believe in low theory in popular places, in the small, the inconsequential, the antimonumental, the micro, the irrelevant; I believe in making a difference by thinking little thoughts and sharing them widely. I seek to provoke, annoy, bother, irritate, and amuse; I am chasing small projects, micropolitics, hunches, whims, fancies.” *Jack Halberstam - Queer Art of Failure*

Not only organic creatures but also synthetic entities can escape human schemes of mastery and control. Technologies can become feral too and today generative forms of AI that operate opaquely through black-box processes, stand as prime examples of insubordination. In this gathering, the creative misuse of AI tech for making and unmaking identities, norms, assumptions, impositions or binaries will help designers, artists and researchers explore the  epistemic possibilities of algorithmic ferality. 

## What?

Algorithmic creatures have crawled into humans lives for many decades but it is only recently, with the advent of so called AI or Machine Learning, that they are able to organize human lives in profound and often unforeseeable ways: from curating cultural content at doom-scrolling speeds or recommending books, tunes and lovers to deciding on insurances, mortgages, jobs and paroles. These AI creatures mostly operate in the shadow of those they affect most, automating (often biased) possibilities with impunity.

Prophetic discourses around AI flourish amidst a generalized ignorance of how these creatures accomplish their feats. Their black-boxed bodies reveal little on how they digest data to produce human looking outcomes. Outcomes that seem to satisfy beyond expectations any and all pragmatic goals they were born to fulfill. However, as self-driving car algorithmic creatures never tire to remind us, technologies need to be scrutinized not only for their intended purposes but also for what lies outside of human control: the unintended consequences, the waste materials, the glitches and the fails. Algorithmic creatures might become feral too.

We will be building on the work on Feral Data by the Open Forest Collective. OF has been engaging with eco-social sustainability through “experimental, situated, embodied, multispecies - or what we call ’feral’ - creative collaborations… feral as a quality to appraise open-ended, spontaneous, unexpected, more-than-human encounters that unfold beyond the bounds of human control, embracing uncertainty and surprise as both generative and critical elements”. (Dolejsova 2023). ‘Feral’ as a concept can be many things depending on one’s positionality and interests. Similarly ‘Feral Data’ is “‘messy’, eclectic, colourful, varied or ambiguous.”(Ibid). 

The purpose of this workshop is to explore feral algorithmic agencies by jamming(-with) algorithmic creatures. In particular, we will be engaging with questions such as: 

- What can a feral algorithm be, or even more interestingly, do?
- What can we learn from feral algorithmic creatures?
- What can we learn from feeding algorithmic creatures not prompts, but feral prompts?
- How are algorithmic creatures different from other (animal, vegetal, imaginary) creatures?

## Why?

> "I use technology in order to hate it more properly."  *Nam June Paik*

AI creatures embed politics that are sexist, racist, ableist and colonialist. This workshop is an attempt to imagine how these algorithms could be different by facilitating a playful context for contestation and critique. A context where the socio-cultural reality of these algorithmic creatures can be, not reflected, but diffracted, hence making possible the production of low theory as a counterhegemonic form of theorizing alternatives within an undisciplined zone of knowledge production.

In *The Promises of Monsters* (1992) Haraway sets diffraction as a counterpoint to reflection.  Diffraction as a term borrowed from physics refers to the effects emerging from the overlapping and interfering of different waves (sound, water, light) as they encounter an obstruction. In line with Karen Barad, we see diffraction as “a tool of analysis for attending to and responding to the effects of difference - diffractions patterns as patters of difference that make a difference” in order to creatively explore entanglements with other-than-human algorithmic creatures responsibly and critically. Gratings instead of mirrors are what allows for attuning to patterns of difference rather than sameness in order to expand the grammars of possibility inherent in these all too present AI algorithms. In this workshop, we are not isolated individuals seeking deeper interconnectedness with these algorithmic creatures, the interconnectedness is already there and we aim to develop our capacity to understand it.

By creatively engaging with these algorithmic creatures, we will explore how our interactions with them are a form of interacting with and between us. Nuanced, critical, playful and perhaps empathic ways of relating to them translate in different ways of relating to ourselves and others. At the same time, we need to be mindful of mythologies of relating to AIs as “life forms” as they obscure human accountability. After all, they are usually and intentionally designed within profit oriented corporate contexts as products and hence, companies are rightfully expected to bear the responsibility for any ill functioning. Jamming (-with) algorithmic creatures might help us challenge the narratives established, more or less explicitly, by AI companies and also explore questions such as: 

- How does one recognize the labor of the people that made the works that went into the dataset of an algorithmic creature? Is it even ethical to engage with them?
- What if a dataset was not a massive and irresponsible scraping of content but rather a precious object assembled with utmost care because it comes from people’s work and will deeply influence people’s lives?
- What if datasets had an expiry date?
- How would AI developed on principles of listening instead of control, situatedness instead of objectivity or equity instead of profit might feel like?

## How?

We will attempt to deliberately subvert, confuse, recontextualize or mock what AI algorithmic creatures were designed to produce as an output by jamming(-with)them. Jamming understood as both, improvising as a form of emergent relationality that results in unexpected and surprising outcomes, and also as making something unable to work by seizing it up or making it unintelligible. For this creative experiment, we will jam with feral data as instrument, after all, both can be seen as a relation between creatures and their context:

knowledge/info/experience → **feral data** → **feral prompt → feral diffractions →** info/knowledge

The focus will be on curiosity, process, frictions and, of course, very celebratory forms of failure. A feral creature is only so in relation to the context where it is situated and value-laden assessments - such as “good or bad” or whether a feral creature is a pest or not are relative and problematic, revealing the position from which the feral creature is evaluated. While the guts of these algorithmic creatures are unpredictable black-boxes, countless hours of work have been spent on ensuring that their behavior follows the (normative) manual. However, a jam is creative expression in relation without a goal or pre-scripted direction. It is both process and destination, insight and exploration so possibilities to turn algorithmic creatures feral are endless if they are fed feral prompts and their outcomes repositioned within the situated context and history of a creative workshop participant. The agency of algorithms in creative ai is coupled with the data they were trained on -  trained on text+img? they can generate text/img - How feral data is made legible to these creatures as feral prompts will greatly influence the feral diffractions they produce with it and the rhythms at which they do so. After all, jamming is also about aligning temporalities with other creatures and creating openings for expressive outcomes. This is no different with algorithmic creatures that were intentionally designed with particular sensitivities to time (TikTok has a different pacing than Instagram, for example). 

## Workshop Structure

The workshop today takes the form of a jamming session structured in three acts: 

### Warm-up

Bring an algorithmic creature to introduce yourself (+ your work & interests) with it.

### Jamming with Feral Algorithmic Creatures (FACs)

Please, first sign up to github with this credentials: 

- user: algoferale
- passw: algoFAC0

Now proceed to the ecosystem where a plethora of algorithmic creatures await your arrival:

- https://replicate.com/explore

We invite you to interpret and adapt this process:

Situaded knowledge/info/experience → **feral data** → **feral prompt → feral diffractions →** info/knowledge

Use your situated experience and personal history as much as possible. Feral data can be anything - a story, a poem, a dream, etc. based on your own life experiences. Algorithmic creatures were born out of statistical generalizations so they won’t see you coming. How you translate your feral data into a feral prompt is very much up to you and will greatly affect the kind of diffractions produced by the algorithmic creature. 

 Some ideas to try: 

- Feed different feral prompts to the same algorithmic creature  - what kind of diffraction patterns appear?
- Use language models algorithmic creatures (or not) to create feral prompts for other (different) algorithmic creatures.
- Play with taboo - explore censorship.
- Get surreal and absurd.
- Twist the instruction manual beyond recognition.

Please, try to document your creative exploration by uploading the feral data and the feral prompts you are feeding the creatures in the folder “Feral Data” and “Feral Prompts” in github and the outcomes you are gathering in “Feral Diffractions”. This will be very helpful for our discussion later on.

### Sharing Feral Diffractions

We will get together to discuss and learn from each other experiences of jamming with algorithmic creatures and the contexts where we find them. Some of the questions we will be exploring are:

- What can a feral algorithm be, or even more interestingly, do?
- What can we learn from feral algorithmic creatures?
- What can we learn from feeding algorithmic creatures not prompts, but feral prompts?
- How are algorithmic creatures different from other (animal, vegetal, imaginary) creatures?
